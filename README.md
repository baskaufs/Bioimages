Bioimages metadata
========

This repository contains the underlying metadata upon which the Bioimages image database and website are built.

These metadata are viewable by humans at http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/ 

Machines can start at http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/index.rdf and follow their noses to scrape the site as RDF/XML.  Sometime I might put the whole graph here (it's about a million triples).

All metadata are freely available under Creative Commons CC0, so go for it.  Since I don't believe that such data can be copyrighted anyway, this designation is probably superfluous, but I'm stating it anyway for clarity.  The images in the Bioimages collection are copyrighted by their owners.  See the metadata for the images for license information.

The code for the horrible software that generates the site will probably be put here at some point.  I have no shame.
