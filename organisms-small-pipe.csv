This large tree grows in the center of the lawn in front of Rand/Sarratt and is almost equidistant from Rand, 
Garland, and Old Central.<br/><br/>
Black oak is another member of the red oak group and its
<a href="../baskauf/13089.htm">leaves</a> are similar to other 
members of the group.&nbsp; The
<a href="../baskauf/13000.htm">lower sides of its 
leaves</a> have variable hairiness, from tufts of blond hair where the veins 
come together to entirely covered with hair (the species name, <i>velutina</i>, 
comes from the term for velvety hair).&nbsp; The sinuses of the
<a href="../baskauf/13183.htm">leaves</a> tend to go deeper 
toward the midvein than the sinuses of
<a href="../baskauf/13132.htm">northern red oak leaves</a>.&nbsp; 
The best way to recognize this species is by observing its
<a href="../baskauf/12316.htm">buds</a> under a hand 
lens.&nbsp; They are entirely covered with blond hairs.&nbsp; The scales on the 
caps of the <a href="../baskauf/16016.htm">acorns</a> are 
also covered with blond hairs.<br/><br/>
Black oak can be found in a variety of habitats, but tends to be on drier 
sites than northern red oak.&nbsp; This particular tree has no branches near the 
ground and unfortunately it is the only black oak on campus.&nbsp; You may find 
twigs and leaves on the ground to examine.  It is noteworthy in that it is described on 
<a href="http://vanderbilt.edu/trees/ofvanderbilt/039">p. 39 of The Trees of Vanderbilt</a>.<br/><br/>
